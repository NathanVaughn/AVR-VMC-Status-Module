The Status module is responsible for consuming status information from the various
other modules and updating the status LEDs connected to the VMC. This also
communicates some with the host Jetson as well to check if itâ€™s being power-limited.

## Developer Notes

The `nvpmodel` application and `/etc/nvpmodel.conf` file must both be bind-mounted into
the `/app` directory.

Additionally, this container must be run as
[privileged](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#runtime-privilege-and-linux-capabilities)
